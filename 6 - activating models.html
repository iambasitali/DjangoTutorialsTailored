        <h4 class="text-muted"><u>Activating Models</u></h4>
        <p>The small model code that we wrote in last lesson gives Django a lot of information, Django can do the following by this code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.</li>
                <li>Create a Python database-access API for accessing Category and Item objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But first we need to tell our project that the todo_app app is installed.</p>
            <p>To include the app in our project, we need to add a reference to its configuration Class in the INSTALLED_APPS setting. The TodoAppConfig class is in the todo_app/apps.py file, so its dotted path is 'todo_app.apps.TodoAppConfig'. Edit the todo/settings.py file and add that dotted path to the INSTALLED_APPS setting. It’ll look like this:</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="prettyprint pre-highlight">todo/settings.py</pre>
                <pre class="prettyprint">INSTALLED_APPS [<br/>'todo_app.apps.TodoAppConfig'<br />'django.contrib.admin'<br />'django.contrib.auth'<br />'django.contrib.contenttypes'<br/>'django.contrib.sessions'<br/>'django.contrib.messages'<br/>'django.contrib.staticfiles'<br/>]
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>Now we have have included the TODO app in setting.py.</p>
            <p>Let’s run another command to create migrations.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="prettyprint">(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations todo_app</pre>
            </div>
            <p>You should see something similar to the following:</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="prettyprint">migrations for 'todo_app' <br/>todo_app/migrations/0001_initial.py <br/>- Create model Categorys <br/>- Create model Items <br/>
                    </pre>
            </div>
                <p>By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models
                        (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a
                        migration.</p>
                    <p>Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re
                        files on disk. You can read the migration for your new model if you like; it’s the file
                        todo_app/migrations/0001_initial.py. Don’t worry, you’re not expected to read them every time
                        Django makes one, but they’re designed to be human-editable in case you want to manually tweak
                        how Django changes things.</p>
                    <p>There’s a command that will run the migrations for you and manage your database schema
                        automatically - that’s called migrate, and we’ll come to it in a moment - but first, let’s see
                        what SQL that migration would run. The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns
                        their SQL:</p>

  <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="prettyprint">python manage.py sqlmigrate todo_app 0001
                       </pre>
                </div>
                 <p>You should see something similar to the following (we’ve reformatted it for readability):</p>

<div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="prettyprint">BEGIN<br/>--<br/>--<br/>--<br/>CREATE TABLE "todo_app_category"<br>"id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,<br/>"name" varchar(200) NOT NULL,<br/>"pub_date" datetime NOT NULL<br/>);<br/>CREATE INDEX "todo_app_item_category_id_1e571fc3" ON "todo_app_item" ("category_id");<br/>COMMIT;
                       </pre>
                </div>
                 <p>Note the following:</p>
                    <ul class="body-ul">
                        <li>The exact output will vary depending on the database you are using. The example above is generated for SQLite.</li>
                        <li>Table names are automatically generated by combining the name of the app (todo_app) and the
                            lowercase name of the model – category and item. (You can override this behavior.)</li>
                        <li>Primary keys (IDs) are added automatically. (You can override this, too.)</li>
                        <li>By convention, Django appends "_id" to the foreign key field name. (Yes, you can override
                            this, as well.)</li>
                        <li>The foreign key relationship is made explicit by a FOREIGN KEY constraint. Don’t worry about
                            the DEFERRABLE parts; it’s telling SQLite to not enforce the foreign key until the end of
                            the transaction.</li>
                        <li>It’s tailored to the database you’re using, so database-specific field types such as
                            auto_increment (MySQL), serial (PostgreSQL), or integer primary key autoincrement (SQLite)
                            are handled for you automatically. Same goes for the quoting of field names – e.g.,
                            using double quotes or single quotes.</li>
                        <li>The sqlmigrate command doesn’t actually run the migration on your database - instead, it
                            prints it to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django thinks is required. It’s useful
                            for checking what Django is going to do or if you have database administrators who require
                            SQL scripts for changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you’re interested, you can also run python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in
                        your project without making migrations or touching the database.</p>
                    <p>Now, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database:</p>

<div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="prettyprint">python manage.py migrate<br/>Operations to perform:<br/>Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, todo_app, sessions<br/>Running migrations:<br/>Rendering model states... DONE<br>Applying todo_app.0001_initial... OK
                       </pre>
                </div>
                   <p>The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied (Django tracks which ones
                        are applied using a special table in your database called django_migrations) and runs them
                        against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the
                        schema in the database.</p>
                    <p>Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your
                        project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes
                        in upgrading your database live, without losing data. We’ll cover them in more depth in a later
                        part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:</p>
                    <ul class="body-ul">
                        <li>Change your models (in models.py).</li>
                        <li>Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes</li>
                        <li>Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The reason that there are separate commands to make and apply migrations is because you’ll commit
                        migrations to your version control system and ship them with your app; they not only make your
                        development easier, they’re also usable by other developers and in production.</p>
